                    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
                    <p>Fair pricing is a new section in the feed and product details page on Wish to educate user on the cost makeup of Wish products to help highlight the value behind the prices of products on Wish.</p>

                <h2>Wish = cheap?</h2>
                <img src="img/fairpricing/problem.png" alt="" id="fairpricingProblem">
                <p>Most Wish products are more affordable than other platforms because Wish tries to eliminate the middleman and the costs in between to directly deliver products to its customers. However, in an explorative user research conducted in April, users reflect that the big difference between the crossed-out price and current price creates a negative image on the product. We want to show users the process behind Wish to build trust among the customers. </p>

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>We want to show our users that we keep Wish product's prices low by eliminating the middleman to our users to increase trust towards products on our platform.</p>

                <h2>Current Designs</h2>
                <p>When this project was assigned to me, there were some designs already in place by the previous designer:</p>

                <img src="img/fairpricing/currentDesigns.png" alt="">
                <div class="textWrap">
                    <p>There were 2 entry points inside the product details page: 1 above the title and 1 below the comments section, which brings users to a bottom sheet with detailed cost breakdowns of traditional retail vs. Wish products.</p>

                <h2>Improving the Flow</h2>
                <p>After reviewing the previous design with product team and conducting user testing, I found that one problem with the design was that the entry point for fair pricing education is too late in the flow to impact user’s perception of Wish products as a whole.T he new design moves the fair pricing education to the feed, which makes it more visible and more effective to impact both the decision-making process of product selection and purchase.</p>

                <h2>Diagram Explorations</h2>
                <p>While gathering feedback from the design and product teams, I created several iterations on the diagram itself to deliver the concept modal in a straight-forward and simple way. I explored different levels of explicitness and format and ran user interviews to test out which diagram performs the best. </p>
