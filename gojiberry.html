                <h2>Information architecture</h2>
                <p>Gojiberry’s architecture is divided into two main components: the Survey tool and the Quiz tool. The Survey tool allows store owners to create, manage, and analyze surveys through an intuitive flow, from defining the content and incentives to customizing and previewing the survey. The Quiz tool, currently in beta, operates independently, enabling the creation and management of personalized quizzes with a focus on content, recommendations, styling, and previewing. Although distinct, both tools share a similar project-based structure which ensures our current survey users a smooth onboarding to the quiz feature as well.</p>

                    <h2>Survey</h2>
                    <p>Gojiberry's survey feature is a tool that helps online businesses gather feedback directly from their customers. Store owners can easily create surveys to understand customer preferences, experiences, and needs. The tool makes it simple to embed these surveys on different parts of a website or share them through links. The data collected helps businesses make informed decisions to improve their products and services. This feature is designed to be user-friendly, even for those without technical expertise, providing valuable insights to drive business growth.</p>

                    <p>Gojiberry's quiz feature further connects zero-party customer data with actionable insights. It allows businesses not only to collect important customer information that can inform the store’s persona but also to drive customer engagement and increase sales by offering tailored product recommendations. By integrating this data with broader marketing strategies, the quiz feature not only improves customer experience but also contributes to more effective and targeted business growth.</p>

                    <p>In today's digital landscape, gathering genuine customer feedback can be a significant challenge. The tools available often fail to provide clear insights into what customers truly think, making it difficult to identify and address problems effectively. Without direct and actionable feedback, businesses are left in the dark, unsure of what aspects of their product or service may not be resonating with their audience. This lack of clarity hinders informed decision-making and can stall growth and improvement efforts.</p>

                    <p>We've developed a 1-on-1 interview scheduling tool for Shopify, available for private beta testing. This tool allows users to choose which customers they wish to interview and select their preferred time slots. Once the choices are made, the tool generates a message and handles the scheduling process with the selected customers.</p>

                    <p>Our first prototype was a 1-on-1 interview scheduling tool designed for Shopify merchants to engage directly with their customers. Despite securing a few beta testers, the tool did not gain traction as merchants either lacked time or had highly specific and varied interview methods, ranging from in-depth, hour-long sessions to brief 15-minute calls or recruiting power users. </p>
